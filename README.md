## Theoretical Part

1. Blockchain Basics
 A.  Define blockchain in your own words (100–150 words).

   Ans --Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner. Instead of being stored in a single location, data is distributed across a network of computers (nodes), where each participant has a copy of the full ledger. Transactions are grouped into blocks, and each block is linked to the previous one using cryptographic hashes, forming a chain — hence the name "blockchain". Once added to the chain, data cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks, which is computationally impractical. This makes blockchain highly secure and trustworthy for storing information. The technology eliminates the need for a central authority, allowing for peer-to-peer trust and verification, which is ideal for finance, supply chains, identity management, and more.

B.List 2 real-life use cases 
  (i) it is very useful in healthcare sector for maintaining the patient records
  (ii) it also very useful in the Real estate sector 


2.Block Anatomy
 A.Draw a block showing: data, previous hash, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root.
|     Block                   |
Previous Hash :	Ety3yr4gg4u2gjr
| Timestamp    : 	2025-06-07 08:30:00
| Nonce	        :5276381
|Merkle Root	     :Yeghr2rjjh
              Data 
AB : 2BTC

  B.Briefly explain with an example how the Merkle root helps verify data integrity.
  The Merkle root is a single hash that represents all transactions in a block. It helps verify data integrity efficiently, without storing or comparing every transaction individually.
